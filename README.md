# Training of Quantum Boltzmann Machines

Library for training QBMs based on [`quimb`](https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a popular python library for quantum information and many-body physics, with MPI acceleration and Tensor Network methods.

## Setup

The package environment is handled by [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) which will install all the dependencies and the package when running `poetry install` in the root folder of the project.
